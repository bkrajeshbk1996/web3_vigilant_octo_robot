**This course is in progress and help is appreciated!**

## Lessons

You are **just writing JavaScript for the browser**.

There is even a small code editor that lets you **try out code right on the page**.

Every part finishes with an example app where you can apply your new knowledge right away.

### Part I: Reading Data from a Blockchain Network

The first part is about the basics, connecting to a blockchain network, reading data, etc.
You only need a modern browser and that's it.

### Part II: Writing Data to a Blockchain Network (WIP)

The second part is about getting more interactive, you will need to install a wallet extension to
your browser and create your first accounts.

## Ethereum Edition

This is the Ethereum edition, which uses the Ethereum network as an example.

The Ethereum ecosystem is a vast landscape if you're just starting out, you might be dazzled by all the networks, dev environments, wallets, and whatnot.
